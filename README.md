# MSSQL server BPG vs None-BPG workshop

This workshop is showing you how to setup a MSSQL server using not following Best Practice Guides (BPG)vs. a BPG setup MSSQL server.
The test will be run using HammerDB 3.3 using consistent installation via scripted configuration using Powershell and SQL files.

This way the bases are the same and the HammerDB will show the differences between a BPG and a None-BPG installation.
